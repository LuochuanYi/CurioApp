Here’s the first look at **Curio’s visual branding** 🎨 — click/open the card above to see the logo concept.  

### 🔑 Branding Elements
- **Mascot Logo**: A friendly robot face inside a circular badge, with warm orange eyes and playful signal waves — instantly recognizable as Curio’s “companion.”  
- **Typography**: Rounded, modern sans‑serif font for the word *Curio*, conveying approachability and clarity.  
- **Tagline**: *“Weaving stories, nurturing minds”* — reinforces the blend of imagination and family enrichment.  
- **Color Palette**:  
  - Sky Blue (#4a90e2) → trust, calm, family‑friendly  
  - Golden Yellow (#FFD700) → playfulness, creativity  
  - Deep Navy (#2c3e50) → stability, tech confidence  
  - Accent Orange (#ff9500) → energy, alerts, highlights  

### 🌟 Application
- **App Icon**: Circular mascot with bold colors, simple enough to stand out on a phone screen.  
- **UI Elements**: Rounded cards, pastel backgrounds, and accent highlights for alerts or active states.  
- **Mascot Personality**: The robot can be animated (blinking eyes, waving antenna) to make interactions more engaging for kids.

👉 Next step: I can draft a **brand style guide** (logo usage, typography hierarchy, button styles, card layouts) so you’ll have a consistent design system across Home, Monitor, Engage, and Personalize. Would you like me to put that together?
Here’s the **Curio brand style guide** we’ve drafted — click/open the card above to see the visual concept.  

### 🖌️ Core Branding Elements
- **Logo Usage**  
  - Always keep clear space around the mascot + wordmark.  
  - Works on light or pastel backgrounds; avoid cluttered imagery behind it.

  - **Headers**: Bold, rounded sans‑serif (e.g., Nunito, Poppins).  
  - **Body Text**: Clean sans‑serif (e.g., Inter, Lato).  
  - **Captions/Labels**: Smaller, lighter weight for secondary info.

### 🌟 Mascot Personality
“Curio the Bot” is the friendly face of the brand — approachable, playful, and trustworthy. It can be animated (blinking eyes, waving antenna) to make interactions more engaging for kids and parents.

👉 Next step: we can extend this into a **UI kit** (buttons, chips, alerts, cards, nav bars) so your developers/designers have a reusable design system. Would you like me to draft that kit as a **component library spec** for React Native?
Here’s the **Curio component library spec** brought to life — click/open the card above to see the style guide poster.  

### 🧩 What’s Inside
- **Logo & Mascot**  
  - Friendly robot face + wordmark “Curio”  
  - Tagline: *Weaving stories, nurturing minds*  
  - Mascot “Curio the Bot” as the playful companion  

- **Typography**  
  - **H1**: Bold, rounded sans‑serif for headers  
  - **Card Title**: Medium weight for section headers  
  - **Body/Regular**: Clean sans‑serif for readability

  - **Primary**: Solid blue with white text  
  - **Secondary**: Outlined blue with blue text

### 🚀 Why This Matters
This spec is your **UI kit foundation**. It ensures every page (Home, Monitor, Engage, Personalize) feels consistent, scalable, and instantly recognizable as *Curio*. Developers can now build reusable React Native components that follow these rules, while designers have a clear visual language.

👉 Next step: I can translate this into a **React Native component library scaffold** (e.g., `CurioButton`, `CurioCard`, `CurioNavBar`) so you can drop them into each screen. Do you want me to draft that code structure?
